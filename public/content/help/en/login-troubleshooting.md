## Common Login Problems

Having trouble signing in? This guide covers the most common issues and how to resolve them.

## Forgot Your Password

If you can't remember your password:

1. Click **Forgot Password?** on the login page
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your inbox for a password reset link
4. Click the link and create a new password
5. Sign in with your new password

**Check Spam/Junk:**
If you don't receive the reset email within 5 minutes, check your spam folder.

## Wrong Email or Password

If you're sure you're using the correct credentials:

- **Check for typos:** Email and password are case-sensitive
- **Remove spaces:** Ensure there are no extra spaces
- **Try copying/pasting:** Avoid keyboard input errors
- **Try a different browser:** Clear cache or use incognito mode

## Account Locked

After multiple failed login attempts, your account may be temporarily locked for security:

- **Wait 15 minutes** and try again
- If still locked, use the **Forgot Password** link to reset
- Contact support if the issue persists

## Email Not Verified

If you created an account but can't log in:

1. Check your email for the verification link
2. Click the verification link to activate your account
3. If the link expired, request a new one from the login page
4. Check spam/junk folders

## Browser Issues

Sometimes browser settings can interfere:

**Clear Cache and Cookies:**
1. Go to browser settings
2. Clear browsing data
3. Select "Cookies" and "Cached images"
4. Try logging in again

**Disable Extensions:**
- Ad blockers or privacy extensions may block login
- Temporarily disable extensions and try again

**Try Incognito/Private Mode:**
- This helps identify if extensions or cookies are the problem

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

If you enabled 2FA but can't access your authentication app:

- Use backup codes provided when you set up 2FA
- Contact support with proof of identity for help

## Still Can't Login?

If none of these solutions work:

1. **Check Service Status:** Visit our status page to see if there's a known issue
2. **Try Mobile App:** If you're on desktop, try the mobile version
3. **Contact Support:** Reach out via the contact page with:
   - Your email address (don't include your password)
   - Screenshot of any error messages
   - Browser and device information

## Security Tips

- Use a strong, unique password
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Don't share your login credentials
- Sign out when using shared devices
- Update your password regularly
